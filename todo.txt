TODO List: Expense Tracker Backend Improvements

1. Budget Management
    - Implement automatic budget reduction when expenses are added
    - Ensure transaction consistency between expense creation and budget updates

2. Error Handling
    - Add specific error message when attempting to delete default categories: "Default categories cannot be deleted"
    - Implement user-friendly notification when Gemini API key is missing: "Please set your Gemini API key in account settings"
    - Return clear error when attempting to delete items with existing references: "Cannot delete [item] as it's currently in use by [reference]"
